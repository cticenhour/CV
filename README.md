# CV/Resume

This repository houses the current curriculum vitae (CV) TeX source files for Casey Icenhour.

Compilation into PDF format is easily done by running `make` within the repository root directory. Note that `pdflatex` is required to build.

# Questions or Comments

Any questions about me or comments on the files themselves (e.g. if you have trouble reading or compiling them) can be directed to cticenho[at]ncsu.edu.
