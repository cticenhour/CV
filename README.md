# CV/Resume

This repository houses the current curriculum vitae (CV) TeX source files for 
[@cticenhour](https://github.com/cticenhour).

Compilation into PDF format is easily done by running `make` within the repository 
root directory. Note that `pdflatex` and `biblatex`/`biber` are required to build.

# Questions or Comments

Any questions about me or comments on the files themselves (e.g. if you have trouble 
reading or compiling them) can be directed to cticenho[at]ncsu.edu.
